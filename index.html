  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Precise location</li>
  <li>User account details</li>

</div>

<h2>How PDF Processing Works</h2>
<p>When you upload a PDF for summarizing or asking questions:</p>

<h3>1. Temporary Processing (Node.js Backend)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your device sends the PDF content securely to our Node.js server.</li>
  <li>The backend does <strong>not store, save, or log</strong> the PDF or extracted text.</li>
  <li>The server only forwards the text to the Gemini API and sends the result back to your device.</li>
  <li>All data is immediately discarded after processing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Processing by Google Gemini API</h3>
<p>The text is temporarily processed by Google's Gemini API to generate summaries or answers.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> According to Google’s policy, data sent through Gemini API is <strong>not used to train or improve</strong> their foundational AI models.</p>
<p>For free usage of Googles's Gemini API, Google may use PDF's or data sent by the user in the app to train or improve their foundational AI models. To learn more refer to Google privacy policy or Google Gemini API privacy policy. </p>
<p>The text is temporarily processed by Google's Gemini API to generate summaries or answers.</p>
 


<h2>AI Disclaimer — Accuracy & User Responsibility</h2>
<p>The AI PDF Reviewer app uses AI for generating summaries and responses. AI may sometimes produce:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inaccurate or incomplete information</li>
  <li>Misinterpreted context</li>
  <li>Hallucinated details</li>
</ul>
<p>Please verify important information independently. Do not rely solely on AI for legal, medical, financial, or other critical decisions.</p>
<p>By using the app you acknowledge and accept that AI-generated content is for informational purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong>We Request users not to share confidential Information in the app.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services (AdMob Ads)</h2>
<p>We use Google AdMob to serve ads.This collection is performed by the ad networks themselves and their privacy policies apply. AdMob may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising ID</li>
  <li>App interaction data</li>
  <li>Approximate location</li>
  <li>Device information (model, OS, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This collection is handled directly by Google and governed by their privacy policy.</p>
<p>You may opt out of personalized ads using your device settings.</p>
<p>We do not control how third-party ad networks use collected data — please review their privacy policies.</p>


<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>Because our app does not require an account and we do not store your PDFs or personal data on our own servers, there is nothing for you to request deletion of. The PDF content is processed temporarily by the Gemini API and is not retained or used for training as per Google's policy.</p>


<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We do not store any PDFs, user data, or personal identifiers. The security of PDF processing is supported by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encrypted communication to the Node.js backend</li>
  <li>Google’s secure Gemini AI infrastructure</li>
  <li>Since we do not store your PDFs or personal data on our own infrastructure, the security of the processing environment is handled by Google. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy when necessary. The latest version will always be available on this page.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Policy and any disputes related to it will be governed by the laws of India.</p>
