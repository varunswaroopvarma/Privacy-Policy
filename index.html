<p><strong>Welcome to AI PDF Reviewer :Chat with PDF</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we process, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

<h2>Summary — Quick Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No account, login, or signup required.</li>
  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal data.</li>
  <li>PDFs are processed temporarily and never stored.</li>
  <li>We use a secure Node.js backend only for processing.</li>
  <li>AdMob may collect device-level data for advertising (handled by Google).</li>
  <li>AI PDF Reviewer :Chat with PDF uses AI and can sometimes produce errors or inaccurate output.Always verify the information before making decisions.</li>
  <li>AI output may contain inaccuracies — always verify important information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>No Personal Data Collection</h2>
<p>Our app does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal information. We do not request:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Precise location</li>
  <li>User account details</li>
  <li>Device identifiers (collected by us)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Important:</strong> This Policy describes what <em>our app</em> does. It does not replace policies of third-party services that the app may integrate (for example, advertising SDKs like AdMob). See the <strong>Third-Party Services & Ads</strong> section below for details.
</div>

<h2>How PDF Processing Works</h2>
<p>When you upload a PDF for summarizing or asking questions:</p>

<h3>1. Temporary Processing (Node.js Backend)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your device sends the PDF content securely to our Node.js server, which is hosted on Render (a third-party cloud infrastructure provider).</li>
  <li>The backend does <strong>not store, save</strong> the PDF or extracted text.</li>
  <li>The server only forwards the text to the Gemini API and sends the result back to your device.</li>
  <li>All data is immediately discarded after processing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Processing by Google Gemini API (Third-Party Processor)</h3>
<p>The PDF content is sent securely to Google's Gemini API for processing to generate summaries and answers. During this process, your data leaves our control and is subject to Google's policies.</p>

<div class="note" style="border-left: 4px solid #ff0000;">
  <strong>CRITICAL NOTICE: Data Used for Model Training</strong>
  <p>As a new application, we currently use the Free Tier of the Google Gemini API.</p>
  <p>According to Google's policy for free services, your uploaded PDF content and prompts (input data) may be used by Google to train and improve their foundational AI models.</p>
  <p><strong>DO NOT upload any confidential or proprietary documents.</strong> We recommend against uploading any sensitive data while we operate on the Free Tier.</p>
</div>

<p>We intend to upgrade to the Paid Tier once usage increases significantly, at which point we will immediately update this policy to reflect that data is no longer used for training. We do not control Google's policies or their abuse monitoring retention periods.</p>
<p>We do not control Google Privacy Policy or Google Gemini Privacy Policy.</p>


<h2>AI Disclaimer — Accuracy & User Responsibility</h2>
<p>The AI PDF Reviewer app uses AI for generating summaries and responses. AI may sometimes produce:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inaccurate or incomplete information</li>
  <li>Misinterpreted context</li>
  <li>Hallucinated details</li>
</ul>
<p>Please verify important information independently. Do not rely solely on AI for legal, medical, financial, or other critical decisions.</p>
<p>By using the app you acknowledge and accept that AI-generated content is for informational purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> Do not upload confidential information or PDFs in the app. Users are solely responsible for the content, rights, and consequences of sharing any kind of information or PDFs with the app.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services (AdMob Ads)</h2>
<p>We use Google AdMob to serve ads.This collection is performed by the ad networks themselves and their privacy policies apply. AdMob may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising ID</li>
  <li>App interaction data</li>
  <li>Approximate location</li>
  <li>Device information (model, OS, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This collection is handled directly by Google and governed by their privacy policy.</p>
<p>You may opt out of personalized ads using your device settings.</p>
<p>We do not control how third-party ad networks use collected data — please review their privacy policies.</p>


<h2>Data Deletion & Retention</h2>
<p>Because our app does not require an account and we do not store your PDFs or personal data on our own servers, there is nothing for you to request deletion of from us.</p>
<p>However, when your PDF content is processed by the Gemini API, Google's policies for abuse monitoring require them to log and retain the input (your PDF text) and output for a limited period, typically 55 days. This retention is solely for policy enforcement, security, and abuse monitoring and is separate from the model training discussed above.</p>


<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We do not store any PDFs, user data, or personal identifiers. The security of PDF processing is supported by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encrypted communication to the Node.js backend</li>
  <li>Google’s secure Gemini AI infrastructure</li>
  <li>Since we do not store your PDFs or personal data on our own infrastructure, the security of the processing environment is handled by Google. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy when necessary. The latest version will always be available on this page.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Policy and any disputes related to it will be governed by the laws of India.</p>


<h2>Terms of Service (ToS) & Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy addresses how we handle your data. Your use of the app is also subject to and governed by our separate **Terms of Service (ToS)**, which outlines important details regarding user responsibility, copyright, intellectual property, and limitations on liability.</p>
<p>By using the app, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. Please review them carefully.</p>
